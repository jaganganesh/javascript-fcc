# 07 Equality

JavaScript provides **two comparison operators** for equality:

- `==` (Loose Equality)
- `===` (Strict Equality)

Although they look similar, they behave **very differently**.

## 07.1 Loose Equality `==`

The `==` operator **compares values only**.
Before comparison, JavaScript performs **implicit type coercion** if the operands are of different types.

```js
// The string "5" is implicitly converted to the number 5 and then compared
console.log(5 == "5"); // true

// The number 0 is implicitly converted to the boolean false and compared
console.log(0 == false); // true
```

> Note: `==` can lead to unexpected results and should be used with caution.

## 07.2 Strict Equality `===`

The `===` operator **compares both value and data type**.
No type coercion is performed.

```js
console.log(5 === "5"); // false
console.log(0 === false); // false
```

> Note: `===` provides more predictable and reliable comparisons.
