# 09 Conditions

Conditions are used to **make decisions in code**.
They allow a program to execute **different blocks of code based on different conditions**.

## 09.1 If

The `if` statement is used to **execute a block of code only when a condition is true**.

```js
let age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are eligible to vote");
}
```

> Note: If the condition evaluates to `false`, the code inside the `if` block will not run.

### 09.1.1 If Else

The `if else` statement is used when you want to **run one block of code if the condition is true and another block if it is false**.

```js
let age = 16;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are eligible to vote");
} else {
  console.log("You are not eligible to vote");
}
```

> Note: `else` runs only when the `if` condition fails.

### 09.1.2 Nested If Else

A **nested if else** is an `if else` statement placed **inside another `if` or `else` block**.
It is used when **multiple conditions depend on each other**.

```js
let age = 20;
let hasLicense = true;
if (age >= 18) {
  if (hasLicense) {
    console.log("You can drive");
  } else {
    console.log("You need a license to drive");
  }
} else {
  console.log("You are underage");
}
```

> Note: Nested `if else` is useful when conditions are **hierarchical** and must be checked step by step.

## 09.2 Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a **shorter way to write an `if else` statement**.
It is mostly used for **simple conditions**.

```js
let age = 20;
let result = age >= 18 ? "Eligible" : "Not Eligible";
console.log(result); // Eligible
```

> Note: Use the ternary operator only when the logic is simple and easy to read.

### 09.2.1 Nested Ternary

A **nested ternary** is a ternary operator placed **inside another ternary operator**.  
It allows you to handle **multiple conditions in a single expression**.

```js
let score = 75;
let grade = score >= 90 ? "A" : score >= 75 ? "B" : score >= 60 ? "C" : "Fail";
console.log(grade); // B
```

## 09.3 Switch

The `switch` statement is used when you need to **compare one value against multiple possible cases**.

```js
let currentDay = 3;
switch (currentDay) {
  case 1:
    console.log("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log("Wednesday");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Invalid day");
}
```

> Note:
>
> - `break` stops the execution of the switch block.
> - Without `break`, execution will continue to the next case (fall-through).
> - `default` runs when no case matches.
