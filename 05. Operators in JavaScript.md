# 05 Operators

Operators are symbols used to **perform operations on values and variables**. They are commonly used for **calculations, comparisons, and assignments** in JavaScript.

> Note: JavaScript also supports **comparison**, **logical**, and **ternary** operators, which are covered in later sections.

## 05.1 Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform **mathematical operations**.

```js
let a = 10;
let b = 5;

console.log(a + b); // 15
console.log(a - b); // 5
console.log(a * b); // 50
console.log(a / b); // 2
```

## 05.2 Assignment Operator

The assignment operator `=` is used to **assign a value** to a variable.

```js
let count = 10; // 10
```

## 05.3 Compound Assignment

Compound assignment operators combine an **arithmetic operation** with **assignment**. They provide a **shorter and cleaner** way to update variable values.

```js
let score = 10;

score += 5; // same as score = score + 5
score -= 2; // same as score = score - 2
score *= 3; // same as score = score * 3
score /= 2; // same as score = score / 2

console.log(score); // 19.5
```

> Note: Compound assignment operators improve **code readability** and help reduce repetitive code.

## 05.4 `typeof` Operator

`typeof` is used to **check the data type** of a value or variable. It is mainly used for **type checking** and **debugging** while writing JavaScript code.

```js
let name = "Jagan";
let age = 25;

console.log(typeof name); // string
console.log(typeof age); // number
```

> Note: `typeof` always returns a **string** representing the data type (for example: `"string"`, `"number"`, `"boolean"`).
