# 02 Variables

Variables are containers used for storing data values. Modern **JavaScript (ES6+)** primarily uses `let` and `const`. The `var` keyword is older and generally discouraged due to scoping issues.

**Declaring Variables**

A variable declaration creates a **named memory space** that can store a value. You can declare a variable and optionally assign a value to it at the same time.

```js
let name; // undefined
```

> Note: Variables are **case-sensitive**, and most developers prefer **camelCase** for naming variables.

**Assigning Variables**

You can assign a value to a variable using the **assignment operator `=`**.

```js
let name = "Jagan"; // Jagan
```

## 02.1 var

`var` is the **oldest way** to declare variables in JavaScript. It has **function scope** and can be **re-declared and reassigned**, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

```js
var city = "Chennai";
var city = "Bangalore"; // allowed

console.log(city); // Bangalore
```

> Note: `var` is generally discouraged in modern JavaScript due to **scoping and hoisting issues**.

## 02.2 let

`let` was introduced in **ES6** and is **block-scoped**. It allows **reassignment** but does **not allow redeclaration in the same scope**.

```js
let age = 25;
age = 26; // allowed

console.log(age); // 26
```

## 02.3 const

`const` is also **block-scoped** and is used to declare variables whose values **should not be reassigned**. A value must be assigned at the time of declaration.

```js
const country = "India";

/*
country = "Singapore"; // Not allowed
*/

console.log(country); // India
```

> Note: `const` does **not** make objects or arrays immutable — only the **reference** is constant.
