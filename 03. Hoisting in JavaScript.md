# 03 Hoisting

Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are processed before code execution begins.

## 03.1 Variable Hoisting

The behavior of hoisting depends on **how the variable is declared**.

### 03.1.1 `var` Hoisting

Variables declared with `var` are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`.

```js
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;
```

### 03.1.2 `let` and `const` Hoisting

Variables declared with `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in an error due to the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**.

```js
console.log(b); // ReferenceError
let b = 20;
```

> Note: The **Temporal Dead Zone** is the time between entering a scope and declaring the variable, during which the variable cannot be accessed.

## 03.2 Function Hoisting

### 03.2.1 Function Declaration

Function declarations are **fully hoisted**, meaning they can be called before they are defined.

```js
greet();

function greet() {
  console.log("Hola!");
}
```

### 03.2.2 Function Expression

Function expressions are **not hoisted** the same way. If assigned to `var`, only the variable is hoisted.

```js
sayHi(); // TypeError

var sayHi = function () {
  console.log("Hi");
};
```

##### Problems Caused by Hoisting

- Accessing variables before declaration can cause **unexpected bugs**
- `var` hoisting can silently return `undefined`
- `let` and `const` can throw **ReferenceError** due to TDZ
- Function expressions may cause **TypeError** if called early

##### Solutions and Best Practices

- Always **declare variables at the top of their scope**
- Prefer `let` and `const` over `var`
- Avoid using variables before they are declared
- Use **function declarations** when hoisting behavior is required
  > Note: Understanding hoisting helps you **write predictable code** and **avoid runtime errors**, especially when working with larger codebases.
